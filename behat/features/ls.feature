Feature: ls
    In order to see the directory structure
    As a UNIX user
    I need to be able to list directory's contents

    Scenario: List 2 files in a directory
        Given I have a file named "foo"
          And I have a file named "bar"
         When I run "ls"
         Then I should see "foo" in the output
          And I should see "bar" in the output
